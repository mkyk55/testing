                <p>Atomic design - An atom is the basic unit of an element. An atom is a form of matter which may not be further broken down using any chemical means. In Design - You first consider what you need to build your interface. From there, you start
                    by creating the smallest meaningful items, atoms. When all of the atoms are built, you turn your attention to the slightly bigger meaningful items until you have a molecule. Once you’ve combined several molecules, you’ll be able to
                    create a more complex structure, an organism.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a part of a series of web accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international standards organization
                    for the Internet. They are basically a set of recommendations for making Web content more accessible, primarily for people with disabilities.</p>

                <p>Mostly websites are built with normal human beings in mind. But WHO report says that about 15% of the world's population lives with some of the disability? When we start to think, we get many questions in our mind. How will a blind person
                    access a website? How will a person with hearing impairment be able to hear an audio or a live speech shown in a website? To cater to all these questions, we have a set of Accessibility Guidelines which guide us to build websites keeping
                    everyone in mind.</p>
                <p>When we follow all these Accessibility Guidelines, even the people with disabilities will be able to access the website with ease. For further reading, click source. Every website should be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust
                    (POUR)according to the international standards by WCAG. WCAG has a set of guidelines to achieve the products/application that is,</p>
